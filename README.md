# Lumberjack Bot

Lumberjack is a very simple game on Telegram's platform and I put this bot together in a few hours. Still, it's nice! Definitely check it out, just type @gamebot and choose Lumberjack in any message window.

# How To Use It

I ran it on Windows 10 platform, 1920x1080 resolution, with Edge as the browser. Press `Num Lock` when the game is ready to begin and press `R` to stop the bot from clicking.

# High Score

The bot was able to achieve a 510 high score and averages around 450.

# Room For Improvement

* You could zoom out the browser in order to see more trees coming, though you need to update parameters in the program accordingly.
* You could keep track of both sides, meaning if there's a obstacle at right side in 4 clicks, you detect how many clicks can be pressed on the left after that, and then after the obsctacle on the left and so on.
